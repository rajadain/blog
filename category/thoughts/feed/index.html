				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that man&#8217;s consciousness is a uniquely distinct feature, present in humans and not in animals, a fundamental difference of <em>kind</em> rather than of simple <em>degree</em> of complexity of neurons in one&#8217;s brain, is one that has largely fallen out of fashion in modern sociobiological and physiological circles that tend to define human behavior as emergent, something that is simply a sum of its parts, that can be explained by reducing the components to an ever more fundamental level and reconstructing the system from first principles learned by the study of its smallest constituents.</p>
<p>In his essay <em>Rediscovering the Mind</em>, Harold J. Morowitz deconstructs the folly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The strictly reductionist approach to human behavior so characteristic of sociobiology also runs into trouble on more narrowly biological grounds. For it includes an assumption of continuity in evolution from early mammals to man, which implies that the mind, or consciousness, was not a radical departure. Such an assumption is hardly justified when one considers the dramatic instances of discontinuity in evolution. The origin of the universe itself, the &#8220;big bang&#8221;, is a cosmic example of discontinuity. The beginning of life, while less cataclysmic, is certainly another example.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>A number of contemporary biologists and psychologists believe that the origin of reflective thought that occurred during primate evolution is also a discontinuity that has changed the rules. Again, the new situation does not abrogate the underlying biological laws, but it adds a feature that necessitates novel ways of thinking about the problem &#8230; man cannot be understood by laws applicable to other mammals whose brains have a very similar physiology.</p>
<p>This emergent feature of man has, in one form or another, been discussed by numerous anthropologists, psychologists, and biologists. It is part of empirical data that cannot be shelved just to preserve reductionist purity. The discontinuity needs to be thoroughly studied and evaluated, but first it needs to be recognized. <strong>Primates are very different from other animals, and human beings are very different from other primates.</strong></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am biased. About many things. I have preferences, opinions, perspectives, notions, lenses, view-points and point-of-views. I think most of us, if not all, are biased in one way or another, but I do not speak for most of us here. I only speak for myself. And I am biased.</p>
<p>Am I proud of my biases? Am I ashamed of them? Neither. They are just like my hands and feet: a part of me that I spend very little time thinking about. They&#8217;re just there. Just as there is physical pain when I hurt my hands or feet, there is mental anguish when I dent my biases. Just as my hands and feet are slowly changing as I grow older, so are my biases.<span id="more-125"></span></p>
<p>A bias can be rationalized to an extent, but it is not inherently rational. Why do I prefer soft country music to loud club dance music? I could try to argue about it, but given an intelligent enough opponent we could go on forever and still not convince the other. It is an irrational choice.</p>
<p>Choice is the ultimate expression of free will. Of volition, of desire, of taste, of consciousness. It is what separates Man from Beast. But sometimes choice is also the expression of a compulsion. One might choose to spend a Friday evening cleaning one&#8217;s apartment, even when other, more entertaining, opportunities await outside. Yet, if one&#8217;s sense of life demands cleanliness of habitat, then that sense can compel one&#8217;s choices.</p>
<p>In either case, the choices one makes can tell you a lot about that person. Your choices can tell you a lot about yourself. Because in the end, it is not our talents, but our choices that define us. They are as much a part of you as your inherent DNA and incidental body. And choices lead to biases.</p>
<p>Bias is thus an integral part of the self. In fact, when I think of what divides my self from others, what makes me special and unique and <em><strong>me</strong></em>, I think a little my background and my school and my job, but I think a lot of my music, and my films, and my books, and my games, and my love of typography, my love of information both in textual and visual forms, my love of software and interacting with software, what foods I like and what smells I love and which places I remember, how much I hate reality TV and high-pitched nasal voices and sweets that you can&#8217;t taste in the tongue but can in the throat and hipsters and piercings and <a title="Wikipedia, Mehndi" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi" target="_blank">mehndi</a> and bad, bad, bad modern Indian music and fanaticism over sports and people who don&#8217;t think for themselves and all Physical Education teachers from middle school. None of these, taken separately, are particularly unique. But taken together, in just the right amounts, paints on an almost objective canvas a picture of my subjective self.</p>
<p>And thus, bias can be a good thing, inasmuch it can help define your subjective self. If you&#8217;re a modern day hip software developer, you might prefer saying you&#8217;re opinionated, but at the end of the day it&#8217;s just bias plain and simple. Knowing how you are biased can teach you more about yourself. It can also teach you to relate better to others, since once you know that you are biased, you now have an outside scale to measure ideas with, and you can see how others are biased, and try to find a way to resolve that.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware of one&#8217;s biases because they can weaken one&#8217;s ability to communicate effectively. In particular, it can weaken one&#8217;s ability to argue. Argument and agreement are the two primary means of intellectual intercourse between individuals. Sharing a bias can make agreeing very easy. Not sharing a bias is imperative to argument, yet to be unaware of these biases can make the argument very difficult and futile.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Some might say I like to argue. I certainly do a fair amount of it. I&#8217;d much rather spend my time agreeing than arguing, more time loving than fighting. Alas, not everyone shares my biases and we don&#8217;t always agree on things. Furthermore, I&#8217;m interested in the Truth, and one often needs rationality and reason to uncover it. Arguments are the bread and butter of rationality, and thus I use them in pursuit of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The purpose of arguing can be manipulative, when one tries to convince the other of a certain agenda, or it can be innocent, when one tries to use the discourse as a means to discover a common, mutually agreeable truth. In both cases, it helps to have good arguments to seek the goal.</span></p>
<p>But if biases weaken one&#8217;s arguments, and knowing you are biased can weaken your confidence in your ability to argue your cause, why would I suggest that you learn your biases?</p>
<p>Because only when one understands their weaknesses can one work to mend them. Once you know that you are biased, you are aware that there is a difference in the mainstream, politically correct, generally accepted, &#8220;right&#8221; way of thinking, and your way of thinking. You&#8217;re off-center, and with growing awareness about yourself, you can see just how off center you are. Once you know that, you can start correcting the course of your arguments. You can offer better, more acceptable, more relate-able, less offensive, more convincing, stronger arguments.</p>
<p>Stronger arguments are valuable in the first (manipulative) case, because the stronger your arguments the more likely you are to convince your target. But since convincing is the only goal, one&#8217;s actual biases don&#8217;t matter: all that matters is the appearance, the perception of objectivity and sensibility. When creating a persona to play the role of the convincer, one must eliminate any sign of bias, since the mark cannot be lured into trusting you if they can obviously see your bias. In order for me to manipulate you, I must put on a flashy show that directs your attention everywhere except my bias, which will betray my true intent. In this case, the argument is for the benefit of the opponent. The outcome of a manipulative argument is rarely positive, since it is an antagonistic and competitive activity. One party will win and the other will lose.</p>
<p>Stronger arguments are also valuable in the second (innocent) case, because the stronger your arguments the closer you are to the Truth, or at least to a mutually agreeable consensus. Here, bias plays a more interesting role. Since bias is such an integral part of the Self, and an innocent argument is sincere and honest in its search for the Truth, one must be up-front and honest about one&#8217;s own bias. Here the bias can help drive  and guide the argument. You are genuinely interested in the veracity of your bias, so that either you may prove and validate it, or become educated and begin correcting it. In this case the argument is for the benefit of yourself.</p>
<p>In order for the innocent argument to work, it is important to not lose sight of the point being argued. If the participants jump from point to point, if they keep changing the subject of the argument just as they are cornered, then know that it is no longer an innocent argument, since it is now competitive rather than cooperative. The participants here are not ready to face their biases, they are afraid to accept that they are biased, and they lack the knowledge of the self which allows one to accept one&#8217;s biases.</p>
<p>The outcome of a truly innocent argument is always positive, since it is a cooperative activity. Either one party convinces the other of the validity of their argument and the other accepts it, or they reach a point of disagreement. Reaching a point of disagreement is an incredibly valuable part of civil discussion. On one hand it shows you that you agree with the other person on so many things, except these few ones that you disagree about. And on the other it deepens your understanding of yourself and of the other person, because now you are aware of the biases, and that allows you to better see their and your subjective selves in contrast.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve seen how biases work in isolation, and how they work in an argument. We assumed that the interaction between biases and agreement is much simpler, since if you share a bias then you agree by default. But it isn&#8217;t always so simple.</p>
<p>Since biases are vague and irrational and subjective and changing, two people can never really have a perfect overlap. There will always be parts that one finds endearing and the other revolting. Bias is a double edged sword: while it does help define one self, part of this definition requires a distinction between one self and others. Thus, the better defined one is, the further they are from the rest. Loving your self automatically pushes others away.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Bias, for all its glory and achievement, is thus a burden which can deter agreement. And finding agreement is important, since it is an integral part of intellectual intercourse. Knowledge of my intellectual partner&#8217;s biases can help me better understand their message, since I can filter them out and negate their influence. Thus, even if they are unaware of their own bias, or unable to properly account for it, I can help move the conversation along by discounting it for them.</span></p>
<p>This is how people can and do get along, despite being biased. They do so by purposefully ignoring each other&#8217;s bias. They decide that it doesn&#8217;t matter. They decide that they love each other more than they hate the other&#8217;s bias. They forgive and forget, and move on.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If bias is an ill, then empathy is its medicine.</span></p>
<p>The next time you start or join an argument, think about your stance and what it says about yourself. Think about other&#8217;s and what it says about them. And when you do understand other&#8217;s bias, would you rather call them out, invalidate their argument and expose their deviant ways to the world? Or would you rather use that understanding to clean up their argument in your head, extract the signal of their message from the noise of their bias, and help ease their burden? Would you rather cooperate or compete?</p>
<p>Each argument is an opportunity to learn, to grow, to refine, and also to forgive, to understand, to empathize. Remembering this can help preserve our innocence.</p>

<h3><span id="more-90"></span>Origin</h3>
<p>Triggered when I realized that the current version of the Facebook app for Android can look into my phone&#8217;s photo gallery at images that I haven&#8217;t shared with Facebook, and suggest that I post them. Here is a screenshot:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-91" alt="Facebook Image Suggest" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-10-30-15.51.58.jpg?resize=604%2C1007" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-10-30-15.51.58.jpg?resize=614%2C1024 614w, http://i2.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-10-30-15.51.58.jpg?resize=180%2C300 180w, http://i2.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-10-30-15.51.58.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>All three images were the most recent in my phone&#8217;s gallery, and none of them had been shared. I went to check the permissions of the Facebook app, but there was no permission listed for accessing the Photo Gallery. I have also disabled Photo Sync for Facebook which automatically uploads pictures to Facebook from your phone.</p>
<p>The explanations are, in their order most likely to least:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook has permission to access the camera, and access to gallery is implied or subsumed by this.</li>
<li>There is no permission, explicit or implicit, to access the Photo Gallery in Android 4.3 and every app can access it without the need for stating or specifying permission.</li>
<li>There is an actual explicit permission for accessing the Gallery which Facebook does not declare, but it surreptitiously does it anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>While declaring what permissions are required by an app is a very positive step in the right direction, more information is required. We need to know <em>why</em> the app needs that information. For example, consider <a title="QR Code Reader on Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.scan.android.client" target="_blank">QR Code Reader</a>, whose most recent update requires the following new permissions:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-92" alt="QR Code Reader Permissions" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-02-04.18.34.png?resize=604%2C1007" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-02-04.18.34.png?resize=614%2C1024 614w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-02-04.18.34.png?resize=180%2C300 180w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.tuhinanshu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-02-04.18.34.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Why does it need to know my location? Why does it need to be able to modify the contents of my USB storage? As a software developer I can think of a number of possibilities, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I don&#8217;t know what they are really using it for</strong></span>. To have a place where they can explain why they need the permissions, and a mechanism that can help regulate that they do only what they declare they do with those permissions, is essential for the next generation of apps and users, both of whom will need to be better educated in privacy guidelines.</p>
