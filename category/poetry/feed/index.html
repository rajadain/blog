				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does one deal with one&#8217;s own inadequacy?<br />
With true lack of merit, of talent, of acuity?</p>
<p>What do you do when it is shown plainly to you<br />
that you&#8217;re not worth anything of real value?</p>
<p>How do you feel when even after enough chances<br />
you&#8217;ve consistently failed at making advances?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that life is not being unfair here:<br />
you genuinely suck in every possible sphere.</p>
<p>So just shut up and accept that you&#8217;ll never win,<br />
never feel soaring success or happiness within.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re best at is being a loser by far.<br />
You live in a studio, can&#8217;t even drive a car.</p>
<p>You yell at friends and wallow in self-pity.<br />
You reek of sadness, and you&#8217;re not even pretty.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the universe, destiny, karma or fate<br />
that stops you from finishing even one poem straight.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all you, my friend, it always has been.<br />
The awkwardness, stupidity, amentia and cringe.</p>
<p>So just stop trying to find an answer or excuse<br />
for why you&#8217;re being treated like repulsive refuse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because you deserve it, you really do.<br />
And that&#8217;s all there is to it, so now we&#8217;re through.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of wandering in the woods<br />
I came up with this brilliant plan.<br />
A foolproof logic that consistently would<br />
stand up to the most inquisitive man.</p>
<p>The true nature of things is unknowable<br />
and my life had indeed been wasted.<br />
So I devised something showable<br />
with lies within it nested.</p>
<p>A slight untruth that would protect<br />
a saintly, wise recluse.<br />
As long as one doesn’t deeply inspect<br />
it’s certainly not abuse.</p>
<p>I lie for myself, to justify<br />
a miserable, failed persistence.<br />
I lie knowing it doesn’t signify<br />
anything beyond my own existence.</p>
<p>My words won’t stand the test of time:<br />
before long their faults discovered.<br />
Then someone new may begin to mine<br />
the depths of Truth left uncovered.</p>
<p>The most tragic outcome I can think<br />
is of my words enduring long.<br />
Of people trusting an old dry ink<br />
and a convoluted, meaningless song.</p>
<p>But the chances of that are slim and low<br />
for the future’s always smarter.<br />
The coming generations of tomorrow<br />
must go far, and even farther.</p>
<p>So I think I’m safe with my little lie<br />
though my profession it will taint.<br />
The world won’t devolve and have to survive<br />
on the tales of an accidental saint.</p>
<p><span id="more-259"></span></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This is the first poem to graduate from my <a href="https://rajadain.github.io/daily-verse/2016-07-02.html" target="_blank">Daily Verse</a> exercise.</p>
<p>I had the privilege to converse recently with a learned gentleman who had studied Vedic teachings and ancient Indian philosophy a great deal. We talked of consciousness, and how many of his ideas did not fit with the modern scientific view of the world. He responded by defining consciousness with three assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consciousness is everywhere.</li>
<li>Consciousness has the quality of being sentient</li>
<li>When one becomes aware of that consciousness, one is in the state of ultimate bliss.</li>
</ol>
<p>He then proceeded to make a number of statements, which would fly foul in the face of rational inquiry, yet sat well within this arbitrary and odd framework.</p>
<p>This poem imagines a ऋशि <i>rishi</i> (saint) of Vedic times, who after a lifetime of तपस्या <i>tapasyaa</i> (great meditative effort) has failed to find the ultimate truth of reality, and thus makes something up to seem smarter than he was. He hopes that his misinformation won&#8217;t be abused by future generations, and the cost of his lies would be small.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living their lives in ignorant bliss,<br />
their vision straight and narrow.<br />
Woken by touch of destiny’s kiss<br />
and tip of Cupid’s arrow.</p>
<p>Him a dreamer of type and code<br />
from a land strange and far.<br />
Her a dancer of a tribal mode,<br />
and an artist of highest par.</p>
<p>Cautiously they probed for intellect<br />
revealing a matching mind,<br />
finding upon delving deeper that<br />
their interests intertwined.</p>
<p>They spoke of life, love, art and beauty.<br />
Of train rides in the winter.<br />
Of movement, privilege, dance and duty.<br />
Of travel Interstellar.</p>
<p>As they shared their regrets and joys,<br />
commonality was found<br />
amidst space cowboys and robot toys<br />
and adventures outward bound.</p>
<p>Coffee shop, a dance, a concerto —<br />
they met a bunch of times.<br />
But their temperaments did not go<br />
together as did their minds.</p>
<p>Yet through their letters and their writing<br />
unique friendship had been wrought.<br />
For its promise and traits redeeming<br />
they gave it another shot.</p>
<p>What then followed was a blossoming<br />
the like they had never seen:<br />
from Haverford to Northern Liberties<br />
and everything in between.</p>
<p>At the peak of their conversation,<br />
when everything seemed just fine,<br />
came disbalancing their equation<br />
tragedy of closest kind.</p>
<p>Between changing jobs and homes anew<br />
their rhythm was disrupted.<br />
The delicate thread that bound these two<br />
was severed and corrupted.</p>
<p>He tried pulling her back, have some fun<br />
with musical comedy.<br />
It only made her angry, someone<br />
that she didn’t want to be.</p>
<p>Fixated on the idea of<br />
making her happy again,<br />
he pushed too hard, so she pulled out<br />
and that was the very end.</p>
<p>Having hurt one whom he loved so much<br />
he recused himself in shame.<br />
Waiting weeks for cooling down and such,<br />
he appealed to her in vain.</p>
<p>After losing sleep and forty pounds<br />
and forgetting how to eat,<br />
for two thousand miles he flew around,<br />
climbed more than a thousand feet.</p>
<p>On top of Mt. Sanitas he sat<br />
with a paper rainbow bird,<br />
and wrote to her in a letter that<br />
which need be said but not heard.</p>
<p>A mistake which she could not forgive<br />
and he could not forget.<br />
By penning this final missive<br />
he broke the cycle of regret.</p>
<p>Now they live their separate lives<br />
in staging and production.<br />
His yogic mind wouldn’t ever drive<br />
her hips of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Cruel fate gave them a taste of<br />
that which could never be.<br />
It would indeed have been a waste of<br />
a Virginian Wonanee.</p>
<p>Though the fabric frayed and colors ran<br />
the mixing of these two dyes<br />
left a kind of after-taste that can<br />
linger without goodbyes.</p>
<p>Shall the twain ever meet again,<br />
that we may never discover.<br />
Tragic, since she once loved him plain<br />
in ways he’d never loved her.</p>
<p>As Fall nights melt into chilly dawns<br />
and cold December sunrise,<br />
the other’s misty moon sets upon<br />
their own personal night skies.</p>
<p>~ Terence Tuhinanshu, November 2015.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You who I have heard spoken so highly of,<br />
You who mean so much to so many that I love,</p>
<p>You who left ripples so clear and far<br />
Like the shining twinkle of a long dead star,</p>
<p>You whose presence is felt even in absence<br />
Like the after-note of a Veena-string hanging in resonance,</p>
<p>You whose legacy of both body and mind<br />
Has crossed barriers and bridges, space and time,</p>
<p>You who I never met, so cannot mourn, miss or grieve<br />
Are one who was never here, and thus can never leave.</p>
<p>Your choices and moods impress themselves upon my life<br />
Through the veil, reaching across the darkness into light</p>
<p>And I know there is nothing that I can&#8217;t make through<br />
Because although I have no memory, I have an idea of you.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This is an unusual poem for me because it is written from my own perspective: usually I write as a character, as someone else, in a world of fantasy. This is one of my more real works, and lacks the imaginary quality that I tend to use in most poems.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this came when a close friend suddenly lost her father. She had told me of him many times, but I had never met him. I had hoped that one day I would, because he sounded like an absolute legend. Now that he&#8217;s gone I am sad for my friend because she lost her father, but also sad and frustrated for myself because I will never get to meet him, and because I cannot share my friend&#8217;s grief.</p>
<p>But this is also dedicated to my grandfather Pt Lalmani Misra who died long before I was born, and also to my uncle Pt Gopal Shankar Misra who died when I was too young to really know him. These are people that I have heard of, whose works I have been immersed in, whose ideas and values and choices have guided so much of my own life, yet I have never met them.</p>
<p>&#8220;shining twinkle of a long dead star&#8221; is a homage to my friend&#8217;s father who once worked in NASA. Space and time have frequently been the topic of our conversations. There is beauty and sadness in the fact that so many of the stars we see at night are long dead, but they are so far that we can still see their light from eons ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;after-note of a Veena-string hanging in resonance&#8221; is tribute to both my grandfather and uncle, both of whom were masterful and renowned Vichitra Veena players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legacy of body&#8221; refers to lineage, because I know of my friend&#8217;s father through her, and my grandfather and uncle through my mother. &#8220;Legacy of mind&#8221; refers to ideas and work. &#8220;Barriers and bridges&#8221; refer to the cross-cultural acclaim and understanding each of them enjoyed, both before and after their passing. &#8220;Space and time&#8221; refer to the fact that people still remember my grandfather 30 years after his death, not only in India but here in Philadelphia which is so far away. It is also a reference to general work in astrophysics and thus another tribute to my friend&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>&#8220;one who was never here, thus can never leave&#8221; refers to the fact that I never really knew any of them personally, thus they were &#8220;never here&#8221; for me. Yet their persona and effects can be felt, and will always affect the people around me, and &#8220;thus can never leave&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the veil&#8221; refers to the veil of death in the execution chamber of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Harry Potter references are not uncommon in my conversations with my friend.</p>
<p>The spark-lines of this poem are the first two: &#8220;You who I have heard spoken so highly of, You who mean so much to so many that I love&#8221;, and everything else follows from that. The title was the last piece, which dawned on me after I read the poem the fourth time. I was initially thinking of just &#8220;You&#8221;, but that is too vague and doesn&#8217;t capture the central feeling. Also, I like how when reading one gets to the end and the title finally makes sense. It is slightly borrowed from the Sandman volume &#8220;A Game of You&#8221;, although it is as dissimilar in content as it is similar in title.</p>

<p><span id="more-36"></span></p>
<p>I flow,<br />
Free, fluid, fervent, fleeting,<br />
Floating through forests, grasslands, and hills.</p>
<p>You try and use my<br />
Form for you function —<br />
For you farms, for your cargo,<br />
Your wars, your waste, and your dead.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I accept all materials of the Earth,<br />
Yet am tainted by none.</p>
<p>And even as my body<br />
Acts as a conduit for the World,<br />
My Spirit is Free.</p>
<p>~ Terence Tuhinanshu</p>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Some ineffable inspiration from a dear poet friend, whose bravery in the face of harshness, and commitment to all that is good and right in the world is as compelling as it is enthralling.</p>
<p>I also wanted to further experiment with combining lettering and poetry, and try more visually expressive poems, such as <a href="http://www.treereadingseries.ca/readers/masud-taj" target="_blank">H. Masud Taj</a>&#8216;s The Bat. Unfortunately I am unable to find that poem online, and the book that features it is in India, but by altering the lengths of each line, the poem draws out the shape of a bat, in addition to being about a bat, and called The Bat. I don&#8217;t remember when I saw it (probably in the early to mid 2000&#8217;s), but I remember being very impressed by it, and the idea of visual-semantic mirroring stuck.</p>
<h3>Commentary</h3>
<p>This is not the best execution of the strategy of visual-semantic mirroring, which I&#8217;m sure takes a great deal of thought, revision and iteration to achieve. This poem does not really look like a waterfall. This was spontaneous, done in one continuous flow, much like most of my poetry. There are a few edits, and these have been added to the text in this post. Specifically, the phrase &#8216;Your wars&#8217; was added to the last line of the second para, and &#8216;touched&#8217; has been replaced by &#8216;tainted&#8217; in the fourth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is what I want today.<br />
Of course, I could have something else,<br />
But this is what I want today.</p>
<p>The whims of fancy rule my world,<br />
Randomness dictates my way.<br />
Wishes come and desires leave,<br />
And this is what I want today.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think a man of thought and taste<br />
Would have the will to stay<br />
Focused, alert and disciplined –<br />
Alas, this is what I want today.</p>
<p>To fall in love. To be left alone.<br />
To fashion sorrow on her gravestone.<br />
To feel such pain! But who is to say<br />
That my mind won&#8217;t wander and sing with joy<br />
If that is what I want today.</p>
<p>Master of will, slave to whim,<br />
I answer to no one! But within,<br />
I have tortured my soul to please my mind.<br />
And now I&#8217;ll try it the other way,<br />
For that is what I want today.</p>
<p>Did I wander from the holy path?<br />
Did I lose my light and go astray?<br />
I could turn around, try to find my way&#8230;<br />
But <em>this</em> is what I want today.</p>
<p>There is no past, there is no future.<br />
There is no cause, there is no consequence,<br />
There is nothing that exists outside of me,<br />
Not night, not day.<br />
The world is a thought, slipping away.<br />
Should I remember, or should I forget?<br />
This is what I want today.</p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>The first draft of this poem was written on a whim on January 17 2012, as I was trying out the now defunct distraction-free writing web app at <a title="Dead Web App, now redirects to company page" href="http://wasabi.cc" target="_blank">wasabi.cc</a>. Desperate to write something, anything, my numb mind spat out the first line &#8216;This is what I want today&#8217;, and the rest developed from that.</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>As with all my poems, it came out of nowhere, and all my understanding of it is based on reading it as a reader, not the writer. What follows is my interpretation of it, and your&#8217;s can be something completely different.</p>
<p>The overarching theme is desire, want, greed, addiction – consumption. It starts out as selfish but innocent, a stubborn child demanding something it wants. But then we see that it is no child, but one of breeding and intelligence, one who is deliberately giving themselves to the desire. Soon the evil starts seeping out, as the hero progresses from not caring about others to willfully hurting them, as he falls in love and then kills his love just so he could feel the pain of loss (for that was his desire), and once achieved he moves on to other pursuits. He indulges in numerous vices, willfully sadomasochistic acts that burn and twist his mind and soul, simply to feed his ever growing want. His desire has grown from a spark to a blaze that eats everything and keeps growing, no matter how much he feeds it, and the more it eats the more it grows until everything is gone. The world stops existing, but the want doesn&#8217;t. It persists, and it goes on, forever, eating itself and growing and shrinking, existing purely for itself for there is nothing else left.</p>
<h3>Influences</h3>
<p>A major influence on this work is Oscar Wilde, reflections to whose works can be found peppered throughout. The hero is akin to Dorian Gray (the subject of Wilde&#8217;s only novel <a title="Wikipedia's page of The Picture of Dorian Gray" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray" target="_blank">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>), because of many parallels such as being of gentle society, being intrigued by desire, torturing his soul for the curiosity / morbid pleasure of his mind. Dorian Gray also falls in love with a woman, but in a moment of anger is cruel to her. Later he realizes that while he is sad for his cruelty, it gave him pleasure as well. The other Wildean influence is the line &#8216;To fashion sorrow on her gravestone&#8217;, which is a reference to the Artist who fashions the image of The Sorrow That Endureth Forever on the grave of his love in Wilde&#8217;s <a title="The Artist" href="http://www.literaturepage.com/read/wilde-essays-lectures-121.html" target="_blank">The Artist</a>.</p>
<p>Less obvious, almost tangential, influences include <a title="Wikipedia page for Bhagavad Gita" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita" target="_blank">Bhagavad Gita</a>, whose ideas existing for yourself without care for cause or consequence have been twisted to fit the Want. Similarly twisted are <a title="Don't Watch This If You Haven't Seen the Movie!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiAbZeVWP6E" target="_blank">Raju&#8217;s final words from Vijay Anand&#8217;s The Guide (1965)</a>, to describe the utter abandon and carefreeness of the final state.</p>
