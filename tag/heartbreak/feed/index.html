				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living their lives in ignorant bliss,<br />
their vision straight and narrow.<br />
Woken by touch of destiny’s kiss<br />
and tip of Cupid’s arrow.</p>
<p>Him a dreamer of type and code<br />
from a land strange and far.<br />
Her a dancer of a tribal mode,<br />
and an artist of highest par.</p>
<p>Cautiously they probed for intellect<br />
revealing a matching mind,<br />
finding upon delving deeper that<br />
their interests intertwined.</p>
<p>They spoke of life, love, art and beauty.<br />
Of train rides in the winter.<br />
Of movement, privilege, dance and duty.<br />
Of travel Interstellar.</p>
<p>As they shared their regrets and joys,<br />
commonality was found<br />
amidst space cowboys and robot toys<br />
and adventures outward bound.</p>
<p>Coffee shop, a dance, a concerto —<br />
they met a bunch of times.<br />
But their temperaments did not go<br />
together as did their minds.</p>
<p>Yet through their letters and their writing<br />
unique friendship had been wrought.<br />
For its promise and traits redeeming<br />
they gave it another shot.</p>
<p>What then followed was a blossoming<br />
the like they had never seen:<br />
from Haverford to Northern Liberties<br />
and everything in between.</p>
<p>At the peak of their conversation,<br />
when everything seemed just fine,<br />
came disbalancing their equation<br />
tragedy of closest kind.</p>
<p>Between changing jobs and homes anew<br />
their rhythm was disrupted.<br />
The delicate thread that bound these two<br />
was severed and corrupted.</p>
<p>He tried pulling her back, have some fun<br />
with musical comedy.<br />
It only made her angry, someone<br />
that she didn’t want to be.</p>
<p>Fixated on the idea of<br />
making her happy again,<br />
he pushed too hard, so she pulled out<br />
and that was the very end.</p>
<p>Having hurt one whom he loved so much<br />
he recused himself in shame.<br />
Waiting weeks for cooling down and such,<br />
he appealed to her in vain.</p>
<p>After losing sleep and forty pounds<br />
and forgetting how to eat,<br />
for two thousand miles he flew around,<br />
climbed more than a thousand feet.</p>
<p>On top of Mt. Sanitas he sat<br />
with a paper rainbow bird,<br />
and wrote to her in a letter that<br />
which need be said but not heard.</p>
<p>A mistake which she could not forgive<br />
and he could not forget.<br />
By penning this final missive<br />
he broke the cycle of regret.</p>
<p>Now they live their separate lives<br />
in staging and production.<br />
His yogic mind wouldn’t ever drive<br />
her hips of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Cruel fate gave them a taste of<br />
that which could never be.<br />
It would indeed have been a waste of<br />
a Virginian Wonanee.</p>
<p>Though the fabric frayed and colors ran<br />
the mixing of these two dyes<br />
left a kind of after-taste that can<br />
linger without goodbyes.</p>
<p>Shall the twain ever meet again,<br />
that we may never discover.<br />
Tragic, since she once loved him plain<br />
in ways he’d never loved her.</p>
<p>As Fall nights melt into chilly dawns<br />
and cold December sunrise,<br />
the other’s misty moon sets upon<br />
their own personal night skies.</p>
<p>~ Terence Tuhinanshu, November 2015.</p>
