<p><span id="more-36"></span></p>
<p>I flow,<br />
Free, fluid, fervent, fleeting,<br />
Floating through forests, grasslands, and hills.</p>
<p>You try and use my<br />
Form for you function —<br />
For you farms, for your cargo,<br />
Your wars, your waste, and your dead.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I accept all materials of the Earth,<br />
Yet am tainted by none.</p>
<p>And even as my body<br />
Acts as a conduit for the World,<br />
My Spirit is Free.</p>
<p>~ Terence Tuhinanshu</p>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>Some ineffable inspiration from a dear poet friend, whose bravery in the face of harshness, and commitment to all that is good and right in the world is as compelling as it is enthralling.</p>
<p>I also wanted to further experiment with combining lettering and poetry, and try more visually expressive poems, such as <a href="http://www.treereadingseries.ca/readers/masud-taj" target="_blank">H. Masud Taj</a>&#8216;s The Bat. Unfortunately I am unable to find that poem online, and the book that features it is in India, but by altering the lengths of each line, the poem draws out the shape of a bat, in addition to being about a bat, and called The Bat. I don&#8217;t remember when I saw it (probably in the early to mid 2000&#8217;s), but I remember being very impressed by it, and the idea of visual-semantic mirroring stuck.</p>
<h3>Commentary</h3>
<p>This is not the best execution of the strategy of visual-semantic mirroring, which I&#8217;m sure takes a great deal of thought, revision and iteration to achieve. This poem does not really look like a waterfall. This was spontaneous, done in one continuous flow, much like most of my poetry. There are a few edits, and these have been added to the text in this post. Specifically, the phrase &#8216;Your wars&#8217; was added to the last line of the second para, and &#8216;touched&#8217; has been replaced by &#8216;tainted&#8217; in the fourth.</p>
